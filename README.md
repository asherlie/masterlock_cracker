# masterlock_cracker

This program narrows down all the possible combinations for a masterlock to 8

This program takes 3 integer arguments and an optional 4th to further narrow down the possibilities

**1.** Spot of most resistance on the dial while pulling slightly on the shackle

**2.** First whole number position on the dial where one is stuck between two positions while pulling fully on the shackle

**3.** Second whole number position on the dial where one is stuck between two positions while pulling fully on the shackle

**4.** Whichever of the options for third digit is the correct one, as returned by this program run with three arguments (the digit that 
provides the most space to move the dial while pulling fully on the shackle is the correct one)
